<h1>
	Horizon Framework
</h1>

## Introduction

Horizon is a PHP web application framework largely inspired by Laravel 5. It was designed from the ground up to work on
nearly all web servers, while offering most of the same features and a familiar development experience.

Horizon is a great fit for distributed web applications, and works wonderfully on shared hosting. With no strict extension
requirements, support for older PHP versions, dynamic subdirectory support, and automatic legacy routing, it can run pretty much
anywhere.

## Quick start

Clone one of the official starter templates and start developing in seconds. You can also install the framework manually or add it into an
existing project to take advantage of its features.
