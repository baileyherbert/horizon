# Helpers

## Introduction

Horizon is based on Laravel 5 and subsequently offers most of the same global helper functions, with identical behaviors
and parameters. However, we've written our helpers from scratch to support old versions of PHP and to work without
extensions.

## Documentation

Refer to the documentation from Laravel 5 for a list of available helpers:
